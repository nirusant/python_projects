<H1>INF4431 - Assignment 6 </H1>

<H2>Practical information</H2>
<b> Operating  system:</b> Ubuntu 18 <br />
<b> Python version:</b> Python 3.6.7 <br />

<H2>The assignement tasks</H2>
<H3>6.1 Temperature/ CO2 plotter:</H3>
For this script to work I am assuming that the .csv files are in the current directory
, and also that the no files have been removed or altered. <br />
<br />
Other than that running the script should be straight forward. 

usage: <br />
python3 temperature_CO2_plotter.py <br />
<br />
If help is needed: <br />
python3 temperature_CO2_plotter.py -h
<br />

 
<H3>6.2 Visualization web app:</H3> 
usage: <br />
python3 web_visualization.py <br />
<br />

This should run the falsk server and a link to the web-page should now be available.
When visiting the page the images on the front page are the ones generated in task 6.1.

<H3>6.3 Interactive visualization</H3>
Under the genrated images there should be some options for changing the parameters of the images. 

<H3>6.4 Visualization of CO2 emissions by country </H3>
Scrolling down the index page, my implementaion of 6.4 should be visible. 
I have chosen to visualize the data as an heatmap, and not a as bar chart.
This is not what the task asked for, but I saw it as an better way of visualize a datasett with three diffrent parameters.   

<H3>6.5 Documentation and help page </H3>
On the top of the page there should be a link to the help page. 
Just click on the "Help page/documentation: temperature_CO2_plotter.py" text.
